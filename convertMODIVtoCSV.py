# RELEASE NOTES
# Usage:
# $ convertMODIVtoCSV.py input.txt output.csv [source_text]
# An input MOD-IV flat file will be processed and exported to CSV. The contents of a
# source field can be optionally specified to add an additional text column to the output.
# - OR -
# $ convertMODIVtoCSV.py schema
# Prints PostgreSQL friendly CREATE TABLE query. Can be used as the main table for a
# partition scheme. Use the "source" above to populate a field that can be used in the
# partitioned tables.
#
# This initial public release r01 incorporates several fixes that were required when
# processing historic MOD-IV tables. If you haven't worked with MOD-IV before, be prepared
# for non-conforming data. These tools attempt to handle some of the formatting issues,
# but it is up to the user of these tools to validate the data produced. -reiser
